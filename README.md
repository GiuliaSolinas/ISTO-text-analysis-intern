# ISTO-text-analysis-intern
Material for the text analysis internship SoSe2021 @ISTO

Starting Date: September 2021
Where: ISTO LMU Munich (3rd floor)
Coordination: Joy Wu and Giulia Solinas

## Introduction: RStudio.

The intern will make use of R to develop a repository of tools on for text analysis on large datasets. We are integrating our coding workflow on a GitHub repository that can be edited directly through RStudio. 
* To familiarize with GitHub, Git, and RStudio, please check the [materials](https://happygitwithr.com/) on ``Happy Git and GitHub for useR.''
* This GitHub [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) gets you started. 

For the internship, we expect intermediate familiarity with R and Rstudio. Knowledge of the tidyverse packages--especially dplyr and ggplot--maybe helpful. 

## Useful references to work with R.
The R community usually refers to two very useful online books: R for Data Science (at this [link](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)) and R Cookbook (at this [link](https://rc2e.com/index.html)). These books span from basic workflow with R to model building. 

### Material on text analysis using R.

Emil Hvitfled and Julia Silge ran this [fantastic tutorial](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/useR2020-text-modeling-tutorial/) on developing predictive modeling with text using the tidy data principles. They have also published this [online book](https://smltar.com/) ``Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R.''

This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ArthurSpirling/text-as-data-class-spring2021) by Arthur Spirling contains materials from his NYU ``Text as Data'' course from spring 2021.  

For references on text mining, you can consult the book ``text Mining with R'' by Julia Silge and David Robinson [here](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).A summary is available at Julia's [blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/learn-tidytext-learnr/).

### More resources on modeling with R.
Julia Silge is an expert on modeling using R and with Max Kuhn, she is the author of ``Tidy Modeling with R'' ([here](https://www.tmwr.org/)).Modeling is not the main objective of this intern, but it is worth to consider potential applications that may derive.  

## Text analysis: Other references.
There are several resources available online. Members of the Academy of Management from the Terry College of Business of the University of Georgia have created this [webpage](https://www.terry.uga.edu/contentanalysis/research-and-methodology.php/) with links to workshops, resources, and publications.
