The data are from the Kiva's contest [Data for good](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding) set on Kaggle in 2018. The contest's main scope was modelling the borrowers welfare status based on geolocation data and loans. More code's information about the code is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding). 

## Main steps for the research project.
We want to understand what is the "mood on KIVA as a social platform. 
* Step 1: Loans' sentiment analysis
  + What are the recurrent topics?
  + What are the recurrent sentiments on the platforms? How do borrowers frame their activity on KIVA?

* Step 2: Matching KIVA's loans data with the MLI's profiles (I will provide the data)
* Step 3: Sentiment analysis on matched loans and MLI's strategic mission
  + Is there a consistency in the loans and the MLIs' profiles?
  + What are the recurrent themes characterizing the MLIs strategic activity?
  + Is there any conflicting view emerging from the sentiment analysis?
  + What are the strategic implications for KIVA?
