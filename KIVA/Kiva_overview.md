# Overview KIVA data

Date: 13.09.2021

The data are from the Kiva's contest [Data for good](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding) set on Kaggle in 2018. The contest's main scope was modelling the borrowers welfare status based on geolocation data and loans. More code's information about the code is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding). 

## Main steps for the research project.
We want to understand what is the "mood" on KIVA as a social platform. 
### Step 1: Loans' sentiment analysis
  + What are the recurrent topics?
  + What are the recurrent sentiments on the platforms? How do borrowers frame their activity on KIVA?

**Tasks**
1. Understand the data structure and merge the dataset saved in \general.
2. Look into the text analysis resources and make a list of models that can be used for the analysis.
  + Use the DataCamp course Introduction to Text Mining to understand the recommended packages and steps.
  + Try to replicate the workflow on the KIVA project. 
3. Find the relative R packages
4. Test the packages with the data: this step may require data manipulation-

### Step 2: Matching KIVA's loans data with the MLI's profiles 
The MLIs profile data are available at this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/eemyegnvaf4qqrhv9a6h0/h?rlkey=5fhna3dp3qq258wf6626rxyhg&dl=0)

### Step 3: Sentiment analysis on matched loans and MLI's strategic mission
  + Is there a consistency in the loans and the MLIs' profiles?
  + What are the recurrent themes characterizing the MLIs strategic activity?
  + Is there any conflicting view emerging from the sentiment analysis?
  + What are the strategic implications for KIVA?
